      <h2>Welcome</h2>
      <p>Welcome to Grandma’s Quilts, where every piece is crafted with heart, history, and a whole lot of love. My name is Ruth Carpenter. I’m 85 years old, born and raised right here in Avery County, North Carolina. I spent years working at Baxter’s and caring for elderly folks who needed a little extra help—because that’s just what we do around here.</p>

      <p>These days, even though my hands ache from carpal tunnel and my eyesight isn’t what it used to be, quilting is still my joy. I can’t see to thread a needle anymore, so my daughter Cindy and my grandson Ryan help me set up my old-fashioned Singer pedal machine, and I do the rest by hand—just like I always have.</p>

      <p>Every quilt I make is filled with warmth, memory, and purpose. I do it not just because I love it, but because I believe handmade things carry stories—and it’s my way of giving something meaningful back to the world, especially in a time where every bit of support counts.</p>

      <p>Thank you for supporting handmade, heart-made work. It means the world to me, and I hope each quilt brings comfort and love into your home the way they’ve always brought it into mine.</p>
